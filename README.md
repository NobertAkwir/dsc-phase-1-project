# Phase 1 Project

Author: Nobert Akwir Ogwel

## Project Overview

This Project analyzes movies datasets from various movie rating sites (through Exploratory Data Analysis), to assist the head of Microsoft's new movies studio in deciding what type of films to create under their new venture.

### Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but have no clue on how to create movies that'll do good in the boxoffice. We therefore are tasked with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office then translate our findings into actionable insights that will help the head of the new movie studio, decide what films to create.

### The Data

In the folder `zippedData` are movie datasets from:

* [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)
* [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)

* imdb.title.basics
* imdb.title.ratings
* bom.movie_gross

## Method

This project uses descriptive analysis and Exploratory analysis, to gain insights from previously collected data inorder to provide useful overview of the films market and outcomes that will help/guide the new Microsft movies studio on what films to create.

## Results

> **From above bar graphs, we get to observe that the long films have the highest average ratings. But this is affected by the number of votes since very few people watch them. Therefore the second graph shows that the feature films have alot of votes therefore their average ratings might be really a true picture of the whole population.**

> **From above visualisations, we observe that the foreign market gross revenue is higher than that of the domestic market. But we have to put into considertaion that the foreign market is quite large compared to the domestic market hence the disparity. The scatter plot put this into perspective since it shows that the relationshp between this two markets is strongy positively correlated.**

## Conclusion

This analysis leads to three recommendations that will help the head of the new Microsoft movie studio decide what films to create.
>* **They should focus on creating long films. These are films with run times greater than 210 minutes.From our analysis, this type of film had the highest average ratings therefore meaning that the consumers of the subject films really enjoyed them.**
>* **As much as the foreign market brings in more gross revenue from the films, they should try focus their resources in both markets. This is beacause of the strong positive correlation between the gross revenues of the two markets. Also, they should create films that really capture auduinces from both markets since. The gross revnues in the two markets might have huge differences but we have to put into consideration that the foreign market is very large compared to the domestic one, hence the disparity.**
>* **As much as we observe that from average ratings, the longer films are higly rated, from the number of votes, we see that the feature films(60mins < runtime < 210mins) are have the highest number of vote. This translates to more people watching the subject films. Therefore the should also focus on this feature films since they have a large audience hence more people watching.**
